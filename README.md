# Simify Your Life - Needs Tracker
Inspired app from The Sims needs tracker panel. If you are like me, you mostly forget to eat, sleep, or do whatever <strong>on time</strong>. So suppose we have an app to notify you of what you <strong>should</strong> be doing in order to live a happy and healthy life!

### Work is always good, but too much might lead to too little.
#### Pace yourself, and good things are surely on your way!

### App now on Play Store -> [Needs Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.needs.tracker)
